            Traditionally, weather predictions are performed with the help of large complex models
            of physics, which utilize different atmospheric conditions over a long period of time.
            These conditions are often unstable because of changes of the weather system, causing
            the models to provide inaccurate forecasts. The models are generally run on hundreds of
            nodes in a large High Performance Computing (HPC) environment which consumes a large amount of energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, we present a weather prediction technique that utilizes pictures from different
            stations to train simple machine learning models
            It can provide usable weather conditions for the user images within a very short period of time.
            It uses processing of the images by different users and stores that images in a training dataset
            It retrieves the weather condition of the user uploaded data by processing the images sent by the user.


        </p>
      <p>
        These models can be run on much less resource intensive
        environments. The evaluation results show that the accuracy of the models is good
        enough to be used alongside the current state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, we
        show that it is beneficial to leverage the weather station data from multiple
        neighboring areas over the data of only the area for which weather forecasting is
        being performed.

    The project involved analyzing the design of few applications so as to make
the application more users friendly. To do so, it was really important to keep the
navigations from one screen to the other well-ordered and at the same time reducing
the amount of typing the user needs to do. In order to make the application more
accessible, the browser version had to be chosen so that it is compatible with most of
the Browsers.

      Different technologies used in our project are:
      <ol>
          <li>
              Pycharm
          <p>PyCharm is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) by
JetBrains. It is used for development in Python and frameworks like Django.
We can customize it with themes and plugins. It lets us to enhance
productivity while coding by providing some features like suggestions,
MySQL plugins etc.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
              MySQL Client
          <p>MySQL Client are programs for communicating with the server to
manipulate the information in the databases that the server manages. MySQL
is the command line program that acts as a text-based front end for the server.</p>

library used for Image Processing. It is mainly used to do all the operation
related to Images
</p>
          </li>

          <li>
              PyMySQL
          <p>PyMySQL is an interface for connecting to a MySQL database server

      Different modules in our project are:
       <ol>
          <li>
              Weather Reports:
          <p>Admin upload the training image weather data set and maintaining the perfect
dataset for admin. Any details is upload and delete the date in report model. Data set
for weather conditions and traffic positions and area finding the location. IN the
model admin maintaining the training data set. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
              Find Weather:
          <p>User login the page and upload the weather conditions image and next process
image is analysis the admin training data set and lost finding the weather conditions.
It is output for digital image processing. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
              Analysis Reports:
          <p>They will finally report for weather conditions and which area affect for traffic
issues finding the final data report. And using support vector machine algorithm split
the weather conditions for separate process. And user view the all the data in finding
the data process in data set.
</p>
          </li>
            <li>
              Graphical Representations:
          <p>The analyses of proposed systems are calculated based on the traffic issues. This can
be measured with the help of graphical notations such as pie chart, bar chart and line
chart. The data can be given in a dynamical data.
